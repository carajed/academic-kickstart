My focus is on helping schools, districts, and education agencies improve the quality of educational opportunities. I've conducted education research and evidence reviews on a variety of topics, including interventions intended to improve student outcomes, policies related to school and teacher quality, and teacher preparation. I'm the Research Manager of the [Center for Outcomes Based Contracting at the Southern Education Foundation](https://obc.southerneducation.org/) and immediate past president of the [Association for Education Finance & Policy](https://aefpweb.org/). I also teach Economic Inquiry in Education at [American University](https://www.american.edu/soe/policy/faculty.cfm) and talk about education research on Bluesky @carajackson.bsky.socialâ€¬. Earlier in my career, I taught preschool and kindergarten in New York City.
