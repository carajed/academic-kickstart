I sometimes get asked for resources to support the use of research and evidence in education. These are few I've found useful:

The Association for Education Finance & Policy's [Live Handbook of Education Policy Research](https://livehandbook.org/) provides comprehensive, rigorous, objective, and useful reviews of research.

Annenberg Institute's [EdExchange](https://annenberg.brown.edu/edexchange) offers numerous resources, including EdResearch for Action briefs that provide evidence-based strategies for improving schools. 

The [What Works Clearinghouse](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/) reviews the existing research on different programs, products, practices, and policies in education. [Practice Guides](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/practiceguides) on a variety of topics present recommendations for educators to address challenges in their classrooms and schools. 

[Open SDP](https://opensdp.github.io/) provides data, analyses and tutorials for every stage of the analytic cycle, from preparing and standardizing your data, to conducting analyses and producing visualizations.

Urban Institute's [Education Data Explorer](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/) makes it easy to access and analyze education data from multiple datasets.

My regular reads include Brookings Institution's [Brown Center Chalkboard](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/) for blog posts from a variety of education researchers and [Chalkbeat](https://www.chalkbeat.org/) for great journalism on education issues.
